# CPTS422Project
The repo for my 422 project

Checks implemented: Halstead Length, and Comments Count

### Halsead Length:
I used the link you gave me to figure out what I need to count to get this number.

### Comments Count:
I used both single line comments and checked for the start of block comments.
